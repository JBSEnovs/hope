# Images Directory

This directory contains images used by the Medical AI Assistant application.

Required images:
- logo.png - The main application logo (used in navbar)
- no-image.png - Default placeholder for image uploads
- medical-icon.png - Medical icon used in various places

Additional images:
- Other icons and images used throughout the application

To create a simple placeholder image, you can use any image creation tool or download a placeholder image from services like:

- https://placehold.co/
- https://placeholder.com/

For a quick fix, you could rename any suitable image to `no-image.png` and place it in this directory.
