# Security Policy

## Application Security

The Medical AI Assistant application is designed with security in mind, particularly considering the sensitive nature of health data. This document outlines our security practices and provides guidance for securely deploying and using the application.

## Data Handling

### Local Data Storage
- All user data is stored locally on the device or server where the application is deployed
- No data is sent to external servers unless explicitly configured
- Medical symptoms, medications, and health metrics remain private to your installation

### No Authentication
- The current version uses a demo user without authentication requirements
- No personal identifiable information (PII) is requested or stored
- For production use, consider implementing appropriate authentication

## Secure Development Practices

### Input Validation
- All user inputs are validated before processing
- Properly escaped to prevent injection attacks
- File uploads are restricted to specific file types and size limits

### CORS Configuration
- Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is properly configured
- Only required endpoints are exposed for API access
- Helps prevent cross-site request forgery attacks

## Recommendations for Deployment

### Environment Configuration
- Use HTTPS in production environments
- Set a secure SECRET_KEY in Flask configuration
- Keep debug mode disabled in production

### Security Headers
- Configure proper HTTP security headers
- Use Content Security Policy (CSP) to restrict script sources
- Enable X-Content-Type-Options and X-Frame-Options

### Regular Updates
- Keep the application and its dependencies up to date
- Apply security patches promptly
- Regularly review dependencies for security vulnerabilities

## Medical Data Disclaimer

This application is designed for educational purposes only and is not intended to store sensitive medical information in a production environment without additional security measures. If deploying in a healthcare setting, ensure compliance with relevant regulations like HIPAA or GDPR.
