# Image Placeholders

This directory should contain:

- `no-image.png` - A placeholder image used when no image is available

To create a simple placeholder image, you can use any image creation tool or download a placeholder image from services like:

- https://placehold.co/
- https://placeholder.com/

For a quick fix, you could rename any suitable image to `no-image.png` and place it in this directory.
